## Research
Research is clear that directly rebutting or responding to mis- and disinformation is often counterproductive - people are great at remembering information, but not so good at remembering that the information is wrong. However, the evidence base for supporting LGBTQIA+ people and gender diverse people in particular is strong - here's some key findings that show the benefit of affirmation, social transition, and gender affirming healthcare.

- [Mental Health of transgender children who are supported in their identities](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4771131/)

This is the first report of its kind on the mental health of transgender children who have socially transitioned - reversible, nonmedical interventions - changing pronouns, name, and presentation.

Socially transitioned transgender children who are supported in their gender identity have developmentally normative levels of depression and only minimal elevations in anxiety, suggesting that **psychopathology is not inevitable** within this group. They **did not differ from the control groups** on depression symptoms and had only marginally higher anxiety symptoms.

- [Chosen name use is linked to reduced depressive symptoms, suicidal behaviour, and ideation among trans youth](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29609917/)

After adjusting for personal characteristics and social support, chosen name use in more contexts was associated with lower depression, suicidal ideation, and suicidal behavior. Depression, suicidal ideation, and suicidal behavior were lowest when chosen names could be used in all four contexts.

An increase by one context in which a chosen name could be used predicted a 5.37-unit decrease in depressive symptoms, a 29% decrease in suicidal ideation, and a 56% decrease in suicidal behaviour. Depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and suicidal behaviour were at the lowest levels when chosen names could be used in all four contexts.

- [Mental health outcomes in transgender and non-binary youths receiving gender-affirming care](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2789423)

In this prospective cohort of 104 TNB youths aged 13 to 20 years, receipt of gender-affirming care, including puberty blockers and gender-affirming hormones, was associated with 60% lower odds of moderate or severe depression and 73% lower odds of suicidality over a 12-month follow-up.

This study found that access to gender-affirming care was associated with mitigation of mental health disparities among TNB youths over 1 year; given this population's high rates of adverse mental health outcomes, these data suggest that access to pharmacological interventions may be associated with improved mental health among TNB youths over a short period.

- [Intervenable factors associated with suicide risk in transgender persons: a respondent driven sampling study in Ontario, Canada](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4450977/)

Social support, reduced transphobia, and having any personal ID documents changed to an appropriate sex designation were associated with large relative and absolute reductions in suicide risk, as was completing a medical transition through hormones and/or surgeries. Parental support for gender identity was associated with reduced ideation. Lower self-reported transphobia (10th vs 90th percentile) was associated with a 66% reduction in ideation, and an additional 76% reduction in attempts among those with ideation.

Interventions to increase social inclusion and access to medical transition, and to reduce transphobia, have the potential to contribute to substantial reductions in the extremely high prevalences of suicide ideation and attempts within trans populations. Such interventions at the population level may require policy change.

- [Sex Assigned at Birth Ratio Among Transgender and Gender Diverse Adolescents in the United States](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/150/3/e2022056567/188709/Sex-Assigned-at-Birth-Ratio-Among-Transgender-and)

Representatives of some pediatric gender clinics have reported an increase in transgender and gender diverse (TGD) adolescents presenting for care who were assigned female sex at birth (AFAB) relative to those assigned male sex at birth (AMAB). These data have been used to suggest that youth come to identify as TGD because of “social contagion,” with the underlying assumption that AFAB youth are uniquely vulnerable to this hypothesized phenomenon. Reported changes in the AMAB:AFAB ratio have been cited in recent legislative debates regarding the criminalization of gender-affirming medical care.

Using the 2017 and 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Survey across 16 states that collected gender identity data, we calculated the AMAB:AFAB ratio for each year. We also examined the rates of bullying victimization and suicidality among TGD youth compared with their cisgender peers.

The sex assigned at birth ratio of TGD adolescents in the United States does not appear to favor AFAB adolescents and should not be used to argue against the provision of gender-affirming medical care for TGD adolescents.
