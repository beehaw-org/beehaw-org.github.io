# Community wikis

Here you'll find the community wikis made by various of our community members!

## How do I start a community wiki?

1. Create a **Github account**, which will allow you to use Github's web interface to edit files.
2. Go to the [Community wikis folder](https://github.com/beehaw-org/beehaw-org.github.io/tree/main/content/docs/community-wikis)
3. Click "Add a page". You will be prompted to "Fork this repository", which will create a copy of the Beehaw repository to your own github account for you to work on. Proceed.
   * (Learn more about forks)[https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo]

4. For the **filename**, use the **url variant** of your community in **lowercase**, followed with `.md`. Examples:
 
| Community  | URL | Filename |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| [LGBTQ+](https://beehaw.org/c/lgbtq_plus) | https://beehaw.org/c/lgbtq_plus | lgbtq_plus.md |
| [World News](https://beehaw.org/c/news) |  https://beehaw.org/c/news| news.md |

5. Add the following snippet at the top of your new page.
```
---
title: "Your Community name"
---
```
6. Edit the page as wanted.
   * Use the [Markdown Syntax](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
   * For examples, you can look at the "raw" versions of existing wiki pages. Ie: [lgbtq_plus.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beehaw-org/beehaw-org.github.io/main/content/docs/community-wikis/lgbtq_plus.md)
7. Submit your page for review by by "committing the changes", and "creating a pull request" on the next page.
8. Your changes will be reviewed by the Beehaw admins, and merged into the documentation.
