# Community wikis

Here you'll find the community wikis made by various of our community members!

## How do I start a community wiki?

1. Make a Github.com account
2. Go to the [Community wikis folder](https://github.com/beehaw-org/beehaw-org.github.io/tree/main/content/docs/community-wikis)
3. Make a file with the url variant of your community in lowercase followed with `.md`. (examples : [LGBTQ+](https://beehaw.org/c/lgbtq_plus) -> lgbtq_plus.md, [World News](https://beehaw.org/c/news) -> news.md)
4. At the top, you should add this code snippet
```
---
title: "Your Community name"
---
```
5. Edit the page as wanted and submit it.
6. Someone will review it and merge it.
